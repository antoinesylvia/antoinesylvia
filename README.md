-   :point_right: I am originally from the Boston Area ([city of Brockton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icGphpZFYVw&t=1127s)), Celtics and Patriots fan! I miss summer in New England but not definitely not the winter.
-   :computer: What made me get into IT? When I was a kid, my Dad (Engineer) was always tinkering with electronics, building and coding things on the weekend (back in the DOS days). This sparked my curiosity, when I got to elementary school age, I began building and taking things apart to see how they worked, breaking my Mom's computer (hardware/software) a gazillion times, last one I can recall was an old Compaq Presario desktop that came with a Encarta 95 and Jet Moto CD. I eventually landed in a space where I become the defacto help desk computer guy for my family, friends and neighbors for a range of issues (to this day). Here's a quick link to the building of my homelab/office: https://imgur.com/a/iyYBpIc
-   :construction_worker: Career Path: IBM IT Architect -> IBM Security Consultant -> Sabre Security Analyst -> Sabre Security Architect/Engineer -> ?
-   :monocle_face: Interested in helping others, mentoring and successfully prepping people for tech roles/interviews (IBM, Southwest, Citi, LinkedIn and more!). I also mentored youth over the course of several years in the Big Brother Big Sister program here in the Dallas area. I like helping people and paying it forward. Here's a 'How to Break into Cybersecurity' guide which came together as a result helping people land jobs over the years: https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Breaking_Into_Cybersecurity
-   :seedling: Currently learning more **Python**, **Ansible**, **Kubernetes** and Terraform (+Sentinel and Enterprise).
-   :heart: Self-hosting software (helped me pivot into cybersecurity easier and attain certs quickly through lessons learned over the years in my homelab). My curated list: https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Autoplex-Cluster/tree/main/general_apps_info
-   :video_game: Retro gamer and collector (classic consoles/handhelds (70s to early 2000s)). 40+ systems and counting, I'm big into preservation.

-   :basketball: I am 6'8", but don't play basketball for my job (my most FAQ when I'm out) but I still get some time in when I take my kids to the playground! Still dunking.
-   ✈️ My favorite trip thus far was traveling down to Cuba a few years ago, taking in the sights and culture plus learning about one of the largest sneakernets on the planet from the locals (Airbnb host and others), El Paquete Semanal (The Weekly Package). Documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpegk0V-hEw
-   Another cool thing I was introduced to in Cuba was their home grown mesh network aka SNET (citywide LAN). Few years ago it was rare for private citizens to have internet in their home, many went to wifi hotspots at parks/buildings around Havana and had to pay for 1 hour use at an expensive price. Documentary covering the network design, equipment, maintenance and purpose of SNET to serve the people of Havana: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEplzHraw3c
