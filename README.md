# My Github Projects
* [Adblock Load Balancer](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/adblock_load_balancer) - Tool to forward raw DNS requests to the PiHole/Adguard with the least load (2+ required). Built for home LAN usage, my agents run on gen 1 Raspberry Pi units which I wanted to make use of as a summer project for 2023. Components here include: Agents (collect and push server usage stats to metrics server), Metrics (collects server usage data from servers and heartbeat info from agents), and Load Balancer (collects data from metrics server, uses this information as a basis to forward raw DNS requests.

* [Lego Train Powered Up Automation](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/dfw_metroplex_poweredup_train) - Leverages Pybricks firmware, Lego Distance and Color Sensor, and Bluetooth! I have 2 Projects, 1 leverages hub-to-hub communication to enable 2 locomotives to work together utilizing a beta firmware. A 3rd project coming this summer (2023) will utilize a Raspberry Pi, Pi Build Hat for Lego and Remote. Demo links are included from my TikTok. This is a project built to support my kids Hotwheels track.

* [Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Autoplex-Cluster) - My K3 cluster featuring many Raspberry Pis (bought used before the price explosion), Nvidia Nanos, and old x86/64 Thinkpads (collected over the years). The idea here is to scale out my self-hosted web apps (mostly from the [Awesome Self Hosted list](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) on GitHub), learn more about distributed computing, and implement GitOps (repo config holding the desired state). I share my computing resources with people I mentor and my friends who are security engineers.

  ![Kubernetes Cluster Network](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Autoplex-Cluster/blob/ab7a396ae3047457d9c3b55385e86922708b22ae/hardware_info/network.gif)

* [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/pc-toolbox) - Originally forked from Palo Alto under MIT. Built scripts for a CSPM tool called Prisma Cloud. Added in the ability to do custom RBAC and user onboarding at scale (1000s of users and 1000s of projects) which wasn't native in 2020 and much more (compliance reports, alerts reports, backups, etc.). Forked but base project has about 2 scripts remaining out of the 50 I've added. Code structure is meant to be generic so users can plug in their own unique identifiers/parameters.

# About Me
![Boston](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/antoinesylvia/blob/f474daa30a7410869dbdd60be384bf89055ebd38/fenway.jpg)


-   :point_right: I am originally from the Boston Area ([city of Brockton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icGphpZFYVw&t=1127s)), Celtics and Patriots fan! I miss summer in New England but not definitely not the winter.
-   :computer: What made me get into IT? When I was a kid, my Dad (Engineer) was always tinkering with electronics, building and coding things on the weekend (back in the DOS days). This sparked my curiosity, when I got to elementary school age, I began building and taking things apart to see how they worked, breaking my Mom's computer (hardware/software) a gazillion times, last one I can recall was an old Compaq Presario desktop that came with a Encarta 95 and Jet Moto CD. I eventually landed in a space where I became the defacto help desk computer guy for my family, friends and neighbors for a range of issues (to this day). Here's a quick link to the building of my homelab/office: https://imgur.com/a/iyYBpIc
-   :construction_worker: [Career Path](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinesylvia/): IBM IT Architect -> IBM Security Consultant -> Sabre Security Analyst -> Sabre Security Architect/Engineer -> ?
-   :monocle_face: Interested in helping others, mentoring and successfully prepping people for tech roles/interviews (IBM, Southwest, Citi, LinkedIn and more!). I also mentored youth over the course of several years in the Big Brother Big Sister program here in the Dallas area. I like helping people and paying it forward. 
-   :seedling: Currently learning more **Python**, **Ansible**, **Kubernetes** and Terraform.
-   :heart: Self-hosting software (helped me pivot into cybersecurity easier, attain certs quickly through lessons learned over the years in my homelab and importance of data privacy). My curated list: https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Autoplex-Cluster/tree/main/general_apps_info
-   :video_game: Retro gamer and collector (classic consoles/handhelds (70s to early 2000s)). 40+ systems and counting, I'm big into preservation.

-   :basketball: I am 6'8", but don't play basketball for my job (my most FAQ when I'm out) but I still get some time in when I take my kids to the playground! Still dunking.
