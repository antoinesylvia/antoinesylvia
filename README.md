-   :point_right: Originally from the Boston Area (Brockton), go Celtics and Patriots! I miss summer in New England but not definitely not the winter.
-   :computer: What made me get into IT? When I was a kid, my Dad (Engineer) was always tinkering with electronics, building and coding things on the weekend (back in the DOS days). When I got to elementary school age, I began building and taking things apart to see how they worked, breaking my Mom's computer (hardware/software) a gazillion times, last one I can recall was an old Compaq Presario desktop that came with a Encarta 95 and Jet Moto CD. I eventually landed in a space where I become the defacto help desk computer guy for my family, friends and neighbors for a range of issues (to this day).   
-   :construction_worker: Career Path: IBM IT Architect -> IBM Security Consultant -> Sabre Security Analyst -> Sabre Security Architect/Engineer
-   :monocle_face: Interested in helping others, mentoring and successfully prepping people for tech roles/interviews (IBM, Southwest, Citi, LinkedIn and more!).
-   :seedling: Currently learning more **Python**, **Ansible**, **Kubernetes** and Terraform (+Sentinel and Enterprise).
-   :heart: Self-hosting software (helped me pivot into cybersecurity easier and attain certs quickly through lessons learned over the years in my homelab). My curated list: https://github.com/antoinesylvia/Autoplex-Cluster/tree/main/general_apps_info
-   :video_game: Retro gamer and collector (classic consoles/handhelds (70s to early 2000s)). 40+ systems and counting, I'm big into preservation.

-   :basketball: I am 6'8", but don't play basketball for my job (my most FAQ when I'm out) but I still get some time in when I take my kids to the playground! Still dunking.
